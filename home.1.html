    <!--This is a comment. The stylesheet is linked next. You'll have the chance to remix this later in the lesson.-->

       <!--This is a comment. Stylesheets are written in CSS< a srtyling language for webpages. CSS tells parts of a webpage how to look. Our stylesheet is a separate file. We link to it here. You can put your stylesheet in the head of a webpage, but often we link to them to keep our code clean and use single stylesheets across several webpages at once.-->

    <!--This is a comment. Optional: Step 6. Change the style.-->
